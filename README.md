# Overview

AI-Powered Business Report Generator is an end-to-end business analytics platform that transforms raw sales datasets into executive-ready business reports using traditional data analytics and Generative AI.

The application automatically cleans uploaded datasets, computes business KPIs, performs trend analysis, extracts structured business insights, and generates professional executive summaries using a locally hosted Llama 3.2 language model via Ollama.

Designed for Data Analysts, Business Analysts, Business Intelligence professionals, and AI Engineers, the project demonstrates how AI can automate repetitive reporting workflows while supporting business decision-making.
